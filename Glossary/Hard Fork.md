- Nodes that run the old software won't accept blocks accepted by the new software, so the blockchain permanently splits in two
	- One chain used by the old software nodes
	- One chain used by the new software nodes
		- The blockchain used by the new software nodes effectively becomes a new cryptocurrency
- Bitcoin Cash hard forked Bitcoin to allow bigger blocks
