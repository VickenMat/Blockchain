- A blockchain competitor that stores transactions not in a list but in a spaghetti-like data structure
- New transactions have to verify two randomly chosen unverified transactions
- There's no mining (hence no waits and lower fees)
- Many new transactions can be added in parallel
- The Tangle is seen as ideal for IoT (Internet of Things), which features many devices logging data at the same time
- Created by startup IOTA
