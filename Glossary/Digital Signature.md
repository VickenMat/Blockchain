- A method used to verify the authenticity of digital messages such as blockchain transactions
	- You use your private key to encrypt a small tag attached to the end of the transaction and anyone can check the tag to make sure you were actually the one who sent it
- Employs asymmetric key cryptography
	- Authentication
		- Digital signature makes the receiver believe that the data was created and sent by the claimed user
	- Non-Repudiation
		- The sender cannot deny sending a message later on
	- Integrity
		- Ensures that the message was not altered during the transfer
