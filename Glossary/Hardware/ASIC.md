- Specialized computer chip that's hyper optimized to run a particular mining algorithm
- Serious BTC miners need ASIC machines since typical computers and chips aren't optimized enough to run the mining algorithm
- Stands for "application-specific integrated circuit"

ASIC-resistance
- A feature in mining algorithms which gives ASIC's no edge over general purpose computers
- ASIC-resistant mining algorithms make miners do a wide variety of computations so a general purpose computer performs better that a specialized chip
- ASIC-resistance is better because it decreases the barrier to entry and makes mining more accessible
