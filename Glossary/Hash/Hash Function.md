- An algorithm that computes a [[Hash]], or fingerprint for a piece of data
- It should be simple to compute a hash with a piece of data but impossible to reverse-engineer it
- One way function
	- Mathematical function that takes an input and transforms it into an output
	- There is no way to recover/reverse engineer the message from the hash value
- No collision
	- No two or more messages can have the same hash (message digest)
	- Ensures that no two account transactions can collide
- Fixes hash length
	- Irrespective of the data size, this function returns the same hash length
- A simple hash function could take in initials for a first and last name
	- For example, AE could mean Albert Einstein or Amelia Earhart or someone else
- [[SHA-256]] is a type of hash function
