- The speed at which a miner can generate hashes
- Each hash gives the miner a small chance of being chosen to mine the next block, so miners with higher hash rates have a higher chance of mining a block, hence more profit
- The Bitcoin network's hash rate is the total hash rate of all Bitcoin miners put together
- Also known as Hash Rate
