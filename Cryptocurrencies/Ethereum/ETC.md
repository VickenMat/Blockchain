- Ethereum Classic
- Older version of Ethereum
- ETC suffered a major hack in 2016 when $50 million was stolen from a decentralized venture capital organization known as the DAO
- Most ETC users decided to make a [[Hard Fork]] of ETC that rolled back the theft
- This new cryptocurrency became known as Ethereum
- ETC didn't roll back the theft and continued to exist as a separate currency, but ETH has grown far bigger than its older sibling
