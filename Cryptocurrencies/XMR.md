- Monero
- Privacy-focused cryptocurrency whose mining algorithm is ASIC-resistant, making it a good choice for independent, small time miners
- Transactions are totally untraceable as the sender's or receiver's addresses aren't revealed and nobody can even see how much was sent
- However this anonymity makes Monero a favorite coin of cryptojackers
