- One way hash functions to link blocks

What is a blockchain?
- At it's simplest, the [[Blockchain]] is a way of storing information
- At it's core, a blockchain is a secure and decentralized digital ledger that records and verifies transactions or data
	- It does so by creating an unchangeable and transparent record of these transaction, which is maintained by a network of computers rather than a central authority
	- The core function of a blockchain is to ensure the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of the recorded information
- A blockchain is a secure database shared across a network of participants where real time information is available to all members at the same time
- A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks
	- These blocks are linked cryptographically, with each block containing a hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction data
- Decentralized public ledger that keeps track of transactions across numerous computers
	- Essentially a network of computers, or "nodes" that share the same transaction history
- Digital ledger that records information in a secure and unchangeable way
	- It's like a chain of digital blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions and new blocks are added as more transactions occur
	- This ledger is maintained by a network of computers rather than a central authority
- A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and immutable manner
	- Its a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions 
	- These transactions are grouped together into a block and each new block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain
	- This chain of blocks is stored on a network of computers, and each participant in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain
- Let's divide blockchain into 2 parts
	- Block
		- A block is a set of transactions that occur over the network
	- Chain
		- The chain is where blocks are linked to each other in a way where the next block contains a hash to the previous one
		- Even the smallest change will change the hash and break the whole chain, making it difficult to tamper data

What is the goal of a blockchain
- Allow information to be recorded and distributed digitally but not edited
- The whole point of using a blockchain is to allow trustless data sharing in a secure and tamper proof method *update this*
- Share information amongst all parties that access it via an application
- Keep records
	- Digital ledger that records transactions
	- Keeps a record of who sent what to whom and when
	- Can be applied to any transfer of information
- Security
	- Immutable
- Decentralization
	- Unlike a bank or government, blockchain is maintained by nodes
	- Nodes work together to validate and record transactions
	- Decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the entire blockchain, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation

Blockchain ABC
- [[Decentralization]]
	- No single controlling entity
	- The blockchain operates on a network of computers (nodes) which work together to validate and record transactions
	- Reduces the risk of a single point of failure and makes the system more resilient
- [[Immutability]]
	- Once a transaction is recorded in a block, it is extremely difficult to alter or delete, ensuring the integrity of the data
	- Irreversible
	- Permanent
- [[Distributed]]
	- All nodes have a copy of the blockchain
- [[Transparent]]
	- The information stored on a blockchain is visible to all participants in the network, providing transparency and accountability
- [[Glossary/Buzz Words/Security]]
	- Blockchains use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions
- [[Consensus]] Mechanisms
	- [[Proof of Work]]
	- [[Proof of Stake]]
	- Employ these mechanisms to ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain
- [[Trust]]
	- Blockchains create trust in environments where trust may be lacking, as all participants can independently verify transactions and data
	- They do not need to trust each other, only the mechanism behind the transaction being reliable

Benefits
- Eliminate intermediaries/middle men
	- Reduces fees
	- Reduces delays
- Simplify record keeping
- Cost savings
- Increased efficiency


Comparison
- Imagine a digital notebook like a global Google sheets that anyone can write in - *Global Ledger*
	- Think of a Google spreadsheet being hosted on Google's servers, which have a single point of failure and can be hacked, destroyed, or manipulated
	- Instead of a central point like Google's servers, it's maintained by a [[Peer to peer]] network of computers called [[Node]]s all around the world
	- These nodes have access to the full blockchain and are responsible for validating new records along with securing the database against malicious actors
	- 
- Whenever someone writes something new, it gets added to the end of the notebook and can never be changed - *Immutable*
- Everyone can see what's been written in the notebook, and they know it's true because it cannot be changed - *Transparent*
